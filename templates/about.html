<h1>About Routing and View Functions</h1>
<p>What is '@app.route()' and what are View Functions?</p>
<p>
    View functions in Flask are the heart of handling requests and generating responses
    in Flask web applications.
</p>
<p>

    View functions are defined using the '@app.route()' decorator in Flask,
    where @app refers to the Flask application instance. The decorator associates
    the function with a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) route, allowing
    Flask to map incoming requests to the corresponding view function.

</p>
<p>

    When a user makes an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to a specific URL, Flask
    matches the URL to the registered routes and invokes the associated view function.
    The view function then performs the necessary logic to handle the request,
    such as accessing databases, performing computations, or rendering templates.

<p>

    A view function in Flask can be any Python function that the user defines, as
    long as it is decorated with the '@app.route()' decorator and associated with a
    specific URL route. The view function can perform various tasks and generate different
    types of responses based on the logic the user implements.

</p>
<p>

    The term "view function" in Flask is derived from the concept of the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
    architectural pattern commonly used in web development. In MVC, the "view" is responsible for
    presenting data to the user and handling user interactions. The term "view" does not refer to the
    visual presentation of the web page or application interface, but rather to the logical
    component that handles the request and generates the response. It encapsulates the logic and
    the behavior associated with the specific URL or route.
